# Experiences log

Append-only record of the development process: what we tried, what broke, how we
solved it, and what is still open. **Newest at the bottom.**

## How to use this file

- Append a **compact entry** after every work-bearing response/session (investigation,
  code change, decision). Pure Q&A does not need one.
- Use the **full template** for notable lessons, dead ends, non-obvious fixes, or
  locked decisions.
- Never edit or delete past entries; a correction is a new entry.
- Every entry links its evidence (paths, commands, commits) and carries a confidence
  when the outcome is uncertain.
- A dead end must include date, scope, and re-open criteria — never "we tried stuff".

## Legacy experience records

- `engine_host_spike/EXPERIENCE_MAP_SPIKE.md` — Spike B: hosting the MovieEditor map
  display (2026-09-21). Lessons still valid: IL recon first, adopt the editor's exact
  order/values, numeric fingerprints for visual checks, engine-run costs.
- `_port_from_mapviewer/EXPERIENCES.md` — removed in cleanup (commit `f92139d`).
  Recoverable from git history if needed; its theory is banned anyway (AGENTS.md §7).

## Entries

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Agent rules + experience log setup
- Did: wrote root `AGENTS.md` (merged with the existing `#iso` workflow) covering
  lookup protocol, `interface\` rule, no-invented-fixes, map-viewer disposition,
  locked constraints, legacy table, area map, stack, gates, and hard rules; created
  this experience log; appended recall pointers in `SFX_GROUND_RULES.md`; rewrote
  `README.md` as the human entry point; added nested `AGENTS.md` files under
  `engine_host_spike/`, `client/`, `tools/netcode/`, `ui-process-app/`, `native/`.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md`, this file, commits on `cleanup/repo-tidy`.
- Outcome: solved

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Consolidation + cleanup (merge, naming, launcher, Desktop)
- Did: merged all 8 branches into `main` (union-resolved the anim-picker/ability-sandbox
  split; pushed `30d9178`). On `cleanup/repo-tidy`: removed the web viewer and probes
  (`map-ui-explorer`, `web/`, Playwright/three.js leftovers), `_port_from_mapviewer`/
  `_ref_chrome`, unused `ability_sandbox/cam`, legacy `engine_host_spike` hosts and the
  actor-map spike; retired `map-ui-app` (text assets → `ui-process-app/Data/text`);
  renamed `reborn_camfp.exe` → `reborn_client.exe` and rebuilt; repurposed `app/`
  launcher to start `reborn_client.exe` (+`RC_MAP` picker) and fixed its Desktop
  shortcut; removed dead JX3 Ani Player leftovers (`player.py` gone since `17385ae`);
  untracked generated per-map structure bins; dropped the redundant 90 MB samples zip;
  consolidated the Desktop to one folder (`_backup/` moved inside, ignored); untracked
  local runtime state (`perf_config.ini`, `launch_*.txt`) per AGENTS.md §9.
- Evidence: commits `30d9178`, `4816d46`..`12d1a81`; `git status` clean; rebuilt
  `bin64\reborn_client.exe` (build_info git id); `_backup\reborn-all-refs.bundle`.
- Outcome: solved. `cleanup/repo-tidy` is ahead of `main`, not merged yet.
- Re-open: merge `cleanup/repo-tidy` → `main` and push; delete `_backup/` after.

### 2026-09-29 — docs — Note inventory + netcode index registration
- Did: inventoried tracked notes (**143 `.md`**: `docs/` 69, `proof/` 30, root 28
  (24 player-era), `engine_host_spike/` 5, tools/apps 10); audited the area indexes
  (`docs/controls` 9/9, `docs/pvp` 2/2, `docs/netcode` 17/21) and registered the four
  missing 绝境 mode notes (`JX3_MODE_GAP_REGISTER`, `JX3_MODE_JUEJING`,
  `JX3_MODE_JUEJING_LOGIC`, `JX3_MODE_LOAD_FLOW`) in `docs/netcode/README.md` (§13).
- Evidence: `git ls-files "*.md"`; index audit command; this commit.
- Outcome: solved. `docs/netcode` is now 21/21 registered.

### 2026-09-29 — docs — Reorganize docs into area folders + indexes
- Did: moved the 32 remaining `docs/` root notes into `docs/camera/` (18, `CAMERA_`
  prefix dropped), `docs/movement/` (7), `docs/engine_host/` (3), `docs/ui/` (2),
  `docs/audio/` (1) and `docs/controls/` (+`PLAYER_CONTROLS_FINDINGS.md`); swept all
  old-path references (50+52 files, incl. backslash variants and the `docs/CAMERA_*`
  glob); generated area `README.md` indexes from each doc's H1 (camera 18/18,
  movement 7/7, engine_host 3/3, ui 2/2, audio 1/1; netcode 21/21, controls 10/10,
  pvp 2/2); added `docs/README.md` master index; updated `AGENTS.md` §3/§10 paths.
- Evidence: stale-path sweep → 0; registration audit output; this commit.
- Outcome: solved. `docs/` root is exactly `README.md`,
  `GAME_SYSTEMS_RESEARCH_MAP.md`, `EXPERIENCES.md`.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Finalize: merge the cleanup branch into main
- Did: merged `cleanup/repo-tidy` into `main` (`085daa7`, 21 commits) and pushed.
  The branch carried: repo consolidation (web/legacy removal, union anim-picker
  merge), client naming (`reborn_client.exe`), launcher repurpose, Desktop
  consolidation, agent-rules alignment, note inventory, and the docs area
  reorganization.
- Evidence: merge commit `085daa7`; `origin/main` updated in the same session.
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — penetration research inventory + main-tip drift audit
- Did: read the camera docs set (`PENETRATION_PLAN`, `WALL_OBSTRUCTION`,
  `HANDOFF`, `HOST_DEVIATIONS`, `COMPLETION_PLAN`, `CLOSE_RANGE_RESEARCH`,
  `FIX_SUGGESTIONS`, `CONFORMANCE_CHECKS`), the camera git history
  (`bdfb586`..`3fd31b4`), and the live code camera block (`RebornClient.cs`,
  `CameraSystem.CameraObstruction`, `FoliageCollision.Raycast`). Confirmed main
  carries the engine look-at/absolute-Y path (D3/B6 closed), 5/9 probes with
  the per-mesh `.cflags` gate, NoCross/scene-min/degenerate-hit guards and the
  `RC_CAM_PENDBG` recorder. Drifts found: (1) the live default
  `RC_CAM_HITWIN`/`RC_CAM_HITWINDOW` is `0`, so B11 hit stabilization is OFF on
  main although `PENETRATION_PLAN` C1d and `HOST_DEVIATIONS` B11 say 0.25 s
  default-on (all added in the `3fd31b4` WIP checkpoint); (2) `docs/controls/
  CONTROLS_GAP_REGISTER.md` S9 and `docs/camera/CONFORMANCE_CHECKS.md` still
  describe the pre-obstruction state; (3) generated foliage bins + `.cflags`
  remain tracked under `engine_host_spike/collision_data`.
- Side-job queue (from `PENETRATION_PLAN`): P0 recorder audit on T1-T4 with the
  current build; P4 missing drawn classes (landscape/bd/subscene -> camera-only
  FCOL); P2 probe footprint (blocked, live host recon); P5 band-aid removal
  after the audit.
- Evidence: `git merge-base --is-ancestor 3fd31b4 main` -> true;
  `client/RebornClient.cs:429,1854,1941`; `client/FoliageCollision.cs:452`.
- Outcome: partial (research done, fix queue defined, drifts not yet fixed).

### 2026-09-29 — camera — T1 penetration root cause: front-only probes; double-sided fix landed
**Problem:** after the engine look-at/guard work the user still reported wall
penetration. The Step-1 recorder had never been run over the T1 sweep, and the
T1 cavity (`18985,682,24515`) is the original user spot.
**Tried:** built the workstream client `reborn_client_camclip.exe` (and first
fixed `client/build_client.cmd` to honor the AGENTS §2 `RC_CLIENT_EXE`
contract it claimed to implement), re-ran the T1 demo sweep with
`RC_CAM_PENDBG=1`, then A/B'd the front-only probe filter and the hit window.
**Outcome:** solved (fix landed, default on).
**Why:** main-tip defaults produced 18 event lines / 192 event-frames at T1:
the resolved camera sat on the far side of rock shell inst 897 (reverse bake
hit 1-2 u from the camera) and of scene-only geometry (reverse scene hit 6-11 u,
bake clear) while the forward front-face-only probes were blind - once the
camera slips past a surface whose front faces it, the forward query can never
see it again and the spring returns through the geometry. A/B: front-only
192 frames; front-only + hit-window(0.25 s) 118; **double-sided 0**.
`RC_CAM_BACKFACE` now defaults on (`=0` restores front-only), registered as
B14 with the real `FilterCamera` (D1) winding rule as the exit. Exact
regressions: T2 `hit=206 len=188`, T4 `hit=186 len=168`, T1 `hit=11 len=0`,
userspot idle pull 155 (`hit=173`) 0 jumps, 45 s route 0 events/jumps,
camera_smoke ALL PASS, exit 0/DONE.
Also corrected a doc/code drift: B11 hit stabilization is opt-in on main
(`RC_CAM_HITWIN` default 0), not the C1d "shipped 0.25".
**Re-open criteria:** the native `FilterCamera` winding rule is recovered, or
double-sided probes cause over-pulling somewhere (kill switch `RC_CAM_BACKFACE=0`).
**Links:** `docs/camera/PENETRATION_PLAN.md` progress log 2026-09-29 (camclip);
`docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` B11/B14; logs `reborn_20260929_122635`
(before) and `_123534`/`_123619`/`_123704`/`_123851`/`_123947` (after) in
`bin64\reborn_out`.
### 2026-09-29 — movement — 二段跳 research + client jump chain (reborn_client_double_jump)
- Did: decoded the double-jump press model from `KCharacter::Jump` (chain gate
  `jumpCount >= MaxJumpCount[school]` 0x140313B19, row = current count at
  0x140313B20, Represent `DOUBLE_JUMP` state + `GetDoubleJumpEndOffset`),
  extracted the full per-school chain (`--chain`; J0 invariant 40,90,11, J1 is
  the 二段跳 signature, gravity clamp 0..31 matters for schools 10/11),
  reproduced it in `client/JumpTable.cs` + RebornClient (J0 unchanged, J1+ per
  press, landing reset, reject log), and added isolated feature-build naming
  (`RC_CLIENT_EXE`, own memory namespace + guard, per-exe build_info).
- Evidence: `tools/gravity/parse_jump_tables.py --chain`; verify_model §6;
  in-engine runs in `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` (A/C clean:
  `djb press n=2` -> `djb land n=2` -> DONE; B/D reproduce the
  `f1b02yd二段跳a.tani` AV, so the tani is opt-in and the client defaults to the
  jump clip); commits `e261499`, `c937973`.
- Outcome: solved. Open: segment-end End-triple trigger, JumpFrameParam curves,
  fly-state re-press path, tani AV.

### 2026-09-29 — movement — 二段跳 corrected: flip mode (user feedback), tani vs ani
- Did: user reported the chain-mode double jump (J1 ballistic, 11.7 m) as "way
  too high / wrong action". Confirmed via MIN2 that the jump clips are in-place
  (bip01 Y=0 all frames), so the arc is physics; the J1 row is the 轻功 flight
  chain and its takeoff-burst/End-phase trigger is still undecoded. Implemented
  the plain 二段跳 as `RC_DJUMP=flip` (provisional): the air press re-uses the
  J0 triple (one extra normal jump, max 2) and plays the authored
  `f1b02yd二段跳a.ani`; kept the raw table chain as `RC_DJUMP=chain` for research.
- Evidence: `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` run E (exit 0; press n=2
  at first-jump apex y=1008 -> land y=646, ~1.9 m extra; `clip -> ...二段跳a.ani
  (0)`; reject n=3), runs B/D (tani wrapper AV 0xC0000005). Doc §1/§4/§5 updated.
- Outcome: solved provisionally; re-open when the `ModifySprintEndSpeed` trigger
  is decoded (then use J1 burst + End triple instead of the J0 re-use).

### 2026-09-29 — movement — 二段跳 unit calibration: RC_JUMP_SCALE=0.52
- Did: user still reported the flip jump as "way too high" and asked to make the
  unit research work. Per `UNIT_SCALE_AND_CHARACTER_SIZE.md` / `JX3_COLLISION_SYSTEM.md`
  G-0 (canonical 1 u = 1 cm), the raw `J0` triple gives a 368 u = 3.68 m apex,
  ~2x the spec's in-game 1.92 m (`REBORN_JUMP_FALL_SPEC.md`; MapSpike used
  `703 u/s`, `1289 u/s^2`). Added `RC_JUMP_SCALE` (default 0.52 = 100/192)
  scaling takeoff AND gravity together, so `J0` realises 1.92 m with the 1.09 s
  air time; applies to flip and chain modes.
- Evidence: `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` run F (exit 0):
  `jump: mode=flip school=0 scale=0.520 (apex 191u)`; press n=2 at y=835 after
  press n=1 at y=646 (191 u = 1.91 m); double-jump apex ~3.8 m. Client log line
  added at startup.
- Outcome: solved. Raw-table mode still available with `RC_JUMP_SCALE=1`.

### 2026-09-29 — client — standing-jump stutter: model transform gate ignored Y
- Did: user reported a stationary jump stutters/"sticks in the middle" (both
  jumps), while holding W looked correct. Root cause: the model-update gate
  (`RebornClient.cs`) only re-placed the dummy when X/Z or yaw changed, so a
  standing jump (py only) never moved the model; with W held the X/Z deltas
  masked it. Added Y to the gate + `lastModelY`, and an apex sample log
  (`djb apex n= py= modelY=`) so the fix is numerically checkable.
- Evidence: `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` run G (exit 0):
  `djb apex n=2 py=1023 modelY=1022` (model tracks physics; before the fix the
  model stayed at the y=646 takeoff height).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — controls — camera-relative steering + turn model (S6), client renamed
- Did: user reported RMB drag could not turn the character while walking. Per the
  control notes (`JX3_MOVEMENT_CONTROLS.md` §2; `CAMERAORSELECTORMOVESTICKY`
  rotates camera **and** character; gap register S6) the client held the world
  direction while the key set was unchanged, so camera rotation never steered.
  Removed the latch (movement direction recomputed camera-relative every frame),
  added the `RunTo` turn model (heading vs facing; facing turns at the π rad/s
  host fallback; a >112.5° turn halves speed and turn step), reused the rate in
  the RMB turn, and renamed the feature build to
  `reborn_client_double_jump_control.exe`.
- Evidence: `proof/controls/steering_run.txt` (demo camera orbit at t=6s:
  `dir=(0,1)` → `(0.78,0.62)`, `yaw` 0.00 → 0.90, path curves; exit 0);
  `CONTROLS_GAP_REGISTER.md` S6 → DONE; `JX3_MOVEMENT_CONTROLS.md` §6 updated.
- Outcome: solved for the steering rule; the server `+0x48` per-frame turn step
  is still undecoded (host π rad/s fallback documented).
