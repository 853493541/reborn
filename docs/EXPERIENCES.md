# Experiences log

Append-only record of the development process: what we tried, what broke, how we
solved it, and what is still open. **Newest at the bottom.**

## How to use this file

- Append a **compact entry** after every work-bearing response/session (investigation,
  code change, decision). Pure Q&A does not need one.
- Use the **full template** for notable lessons, dead ends, non-obvious fixes, or
  locked decisions.
- Never edit or delete past entries; a correction is a new entry.
- Every entry links its evidence (paths, commands, commits) and carries a confidence
  when the outcome is uncertain.
- A dead end must include date, scope, and re-open criteria — never "we tried stuff".

### Compact entry

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <area> — <title>
- Did: <what changed or was investigated>
- Evidence: <files, commands, commit hashes>
- Outcome: solved | partial | dead end

## Legacy experience records

- `engine_host_spike/EXPERIENCE_MAP_SPIKE.md` — Spike B: hosting the MovieEditor map
  display (2026-09-21). Lessons still valid: IL recon first, adopt the editor's exact
  order/values, numeric fingerprints for visual checks, engine-run costs.
- `_port_from_mapviewer/EXPERIENCES.md` — removed in cleanup (commit `f92139d`).
  Recoverable from git history if needed; its theory is banned anyway (AGENTS.md §7).

## Entries

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Agent rules + experience log setup
- Did: wrote root `AGENTS.md` (merged with the existing `#iso` workflow) covering
  lookup protocol, `interface\` rule, no-invented-fixes, map-viewer disposition,
  locked constraints, legacy table, area map, stack, gates, and hard rules; created
  this experience log; appended recall pointers in `SFX_GROUND_RULES.md`; rewrote
  `README.md` as the human entry point; added nested `AGENTS.md` files under
  `engine_host_spike/`, `client/`, `tools/netcode/`, `ui-process-app/`, `native/`.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md`, this file, commits on `cleanup/repo-tidy`.
- Outcome: solved

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Consolidation + cleanup (merge, naming, launcher, Desktop)
- Did: merged all 8 branches into `main` (union-resolved the anim-picker/ability-sandbox
  split; pushed `30d9178`). On `cleanup/repo-tidy`: removed the web viewer and probes
  (`map-ui-explorer`, `web/`, Playwright/three.js leftovers), `_port_from_mapviewer`/
  `_ref_chrome`, unused `ability_sandbox/cam`, legacy `engine_host_spike` hosts and the
  actor-map spike; retired `map-ui-app` (text assets → `ui-process-app/Data/text`);
  renamed `reborn_camfp.exe` → `reborn_client.exe` and rebuilt; repurposed `app/`
  launcher to start `reborn_client.exe` (+`RC_MAP` picker) and fixed its Desktop
  shortcut; removed dead JX3 Ani Player leftovers (`player.py` gone since `17385ae`);
  untracked generated per-map structure bins; dropped the redundant 90 MB samples zip;
  consolidated the Desktop to one folder (`_backup/` moved inside, ignored); untracked
  local runtime state (`perf_config.ini`, `launch_*.txt`) per AGENTS.md §9.
- Evidence: commits `30d9178`, `4816d46`..`12d1a81`; `git status` clean; rebuilt
  `bin64\reborn_client.exe` (build_info git id); `_backup\reborn-all-refs.bundle`.
- Outcome: solved. `cleanup/repo-tidy` is ahead of `main`, not merged yet.
- Re-open: merge `cleanup/repo-tidy` → `main` and push; delete `_backup/` after.

### 2026-09-29 — docs — Note inventory + netcode index registration
- Did: inventoried tracked notes (**143 `.md`**: `docs/` 69, `proof/` 30, root 28
  (24 player-era), `engine_host_spike/` 5, tools/apps 10); audited the area indexes
  (`docs/controls` 9/9, `docs/pvp` 2/2, `docs/netcode` 17/21) and registered the four
  missing 绝境 mode notes (`JX3_MODE_GAP_REGISTER`, `JX3_MODE_JUEJING`,
  `JX3_MODE_JUEJING_LOGIC`, `JX3_MODE_LOAD_FLOW`) in `docs/netcode/README.md` (§13).
- Evidence: `git ls-files "*.md"`; index audit command; this commit.
- Outcome: solved. `docs/netcode` is now 21/21 registered.

### 2026-09-29 — docs — Reorganize docs into area folders + indexes
- Did: moved the 32 remaining `docs/` root notes into `docs/camera/` (18, `CAMERA_`
  prefix dropped), `docs/movement/` (7), `docs/engine_host/` (3), `docs/ui/` (2),
  `docs/audio/` (1) and `docs/controls/` (+`PLAYER_CONTROLS_FINDINGS.md`); swept all
  old-path references (50+52 files, incl. backslash variants and the `docs/CAMERA_*`
  glob); generated area `README.md` indexes from each doc's H1 (camera 18/18,
  movement 7/7, engine_host 3/3, ui 2/2, audio 1/1; netcode 21/21, controls 10/10,
  pvp 2/2); added `docs/README.md` master index; updated `AGENTS.md` §3/§10 paths.
- Evidence: stale-path sweep → 0; registration audit output; this commit.
- Outcome: solved. `docs/` root is exactly `README.md`,
  `GAME_SYSTEMS_RESEARCH_MAP.md`, `EXPERIENCES.md`.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Finalize: merge the cleanup branch into main
- Did: merged `cleanup/repo-tidy` into `main` (`085daa7`, 21 commits) and pushed.
  The branch carried: repo consolidation (web/legacy removal, union anim-picker
  merge), client naming (`reborn_client.exe`), launcher repurpose, Desktop
  consolidation, agent-rules alignment, note inventory, and the docs area
  reorganization.
- Evidence: merge commit `085daa7`; `origin/main` updated in the same session.
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — client — Parallel feature clients: per-build engine namespace
- Did: replaced the name-list single-instance guard with namespace-based isolation.
  Feature builds derive `reborn_client_<slug>.memory` from the exe name (canonical
  keeps `MovieEditor.memory`; `RC_MEM_NS` overrides); the guard blocks only namespace
  peers — the canonical build excludes `asset_sandbox`/`ability_picker` (they still
  hardcode the shared namespace), a feature build excludes only a second instance of
  itself. `client\build_client.cmd` accepts `RC_CLIENT_EXE`/`RC_SMOKE_EXE` and, for
  feature builds, skips the shared bin64 config copies and writes
  `build_info_<exe>.txt`. Rule added: `AGENTS.md` §2 "Parallel feature work on the
  client (isolated builds)" + `client/AGENTS.md`.
- Evidence: live 2-client run 12:27 — `reborn_client_alpha.exe` + `reborn_client_beta.exe`
  concurrently; logs show `ns=reborn_client_alpha.memory` / `ns=reborn_client_beta.memory`,
  both loaded terrain, no crash; `build exit=0` for all three builds.
- Outcome: solved. Shared engine-root writes (ShaderListUpload/dxvk) remain the known
  caveat; root isolation broke init (`d8268d2`).

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Rule: research = copy & analyze, never affect installs
- Did: added the copy-and-analyze rule — `AGENTS.md` §4 (allowed: copy files out into
  ignored dirs, analyze offline, observe running; forbidden: writes, renames, deletes,
  patches, injection — on disk or in memory) and §8 (installs read-only; documented
  `MovieEditor\bin64` build outputs are the only exception). Mirrored in
  `tools/netcode/AGENTS.md` and `native/AGENTS.md` (no in-memory patching; the broken
  `RC_PatchD6` trampoline is cited as the cautionary example).
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` §4/§8, `tools/netcode/AGENTS.md`, `native/AGENTS.md`.
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Rule: never push to origin unless explicitly asked
- Did: strengthened the git rule — `AGENTS.md` §2 default mode ("Never push to `origin`
  (any branch) unless the user explicitly asks; pushing is always an explicit request;
  local commits are fine"), `#iso` step 5 (commit after every change; never push unless
  asked — replaces "push after every commit"), and §13 Git hard rule (same wording).
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md`; this commit, kept local per the new rule.
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Rule: mandatory closing game-design check
- Did: `AGENTS.md` §15 now requires every response to end with the game-design check
  ("Does this respect the game's own design — or are we inventing new ways / band-aid
  fixes?" -> "No — we are not inventing fixes ourselves; we connect the real game
  engines and reproduce the original game design, not band-aid around it."), with the
  caveat that a provisional deviation must be named explicitly (§6) rather than
  silently answered "no".
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` §15; this commit (local).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Rule: sandbox windows title as sandbox-<featurename>
- Did: `AGENTS.md` §2 item 7 requires feature/sandbox apps to set their top-left window
  title to `sandbox-<featurename>`; implemented: the client derives `sandbox-<slug>` from
  `reborn_client_<slug>.exe` (canonical keeps `JX3`), `ability_sandbox` ->
  `sandbox-ability`, `asset_sandbox` -> `sandbox-asset`; all three rebuilt (`exit=0` /
  `build OK`); `client/AGENTS.md` note added.
- Evidence: `client\RebornClient.cs`, `ability_sandbox\rb\RebornClient.cs`,
  `asset_sandbox\AssetSandbox.cs`, `AGENTS.md` §2.7; this commit (local).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — tooling — "Too many images in request" (API caps images at 30)
**Problem:** long sessions that Read image files (screenshots, proof PNGs) accumulate
image parts in the conversation; every later request fails with
`invalid_request_error: Too many images in request: 31 > 30`, blocking the session.
**Tried:** mitigation is not possible once the cap is hit - prevention only.
**Outcome:** solved (prevention).
**Why:** the API counts every image in the whole conversation, not just the latest
message; attachments persist in history. One session must stay under 30 total.
**Re-open criteria:** the provider raises the cap, or opencode strips old image parts
from history automatically.
**Links:** `tools/proof/image_stats.py`, `tools/proof/README.md`, `AGENTS.md` §13 Images.

### 2026-09-29 — engine_host — Mini-sandbox branch review (`agent/mini-sandbox`)
- Did: reviewed the cropped-loose-map sandbox branch vs `main`: builder
  (`tools/sandbox/build_sandbox.py`, official extractor, world coords preserved,
  manifest + sha1), client delta (RC_PHYS_DLL, init/LoadMap ms, title), verified runs
  (`proof/sandbox/*`: 1x1 = 6.5 MiB, LoadMap 156 ms vs 1.6 s full, fps 231-274).
- Evidence: merge-base diff `ff67fff..agent/mini-sandbox`; `MINI_SANDBOX_CLIENT.md`.
- Outcome: solved (review). Verdict: pull-ready; conflicts = title hunk + doc appends;
  convention fix needed (`Sandbox-pure` -> `sandbox-mini`); builder `--client-root` arg
  accepted but unused.

### 2026-09-29 — engine_host — Install-write audit: shader cache under zhcn_hd\CachedShaders
**Problem:** the copy-and-analyze rule (`AGENTS.md` §4/§8) bans writes under
`C:\SeasunGame` except documented `MovieEditor\bin64` outputs. A read-only check during
the mini-sandbox review found files in
`C:\SeasunGame\Game\JX3\bin\zhcn_hd\CachedShaders` dated 09-29 20:32/21:00/21:02/21:28
that coincide with our engine runs (20:32 is the branch's disclosed junction experiment).
**Tried:** read-only attribution (no writes); repo grep - the path is not documented
anywhere.
**Outcome:** open (finding) - attribution not yet proven by a controlled run.
**Why:** likely the engine writes its shader cache under the asset root (`workingDir` =
`zhcn_hd` in the client), i.e. every host run may write there.
**Re-open criteria:** controlled canonical run watching `zhcn_hd\CachedShaders` mtimes
before/after; if confirmed, find an engine redirect or register a documented deviation.
**Links:** `docs/engine_host/MINI_SANDBOX_CLIENT.md` dead-end #1; `AGENTS.md` §4/§8.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Rule: full-chain ownership (the agent is the tester)
- Did: `AGENTS.md` §15 now requires the agent to own the whole chain for any repeated
  problem or fix request: reproduce deterministically (scripted repro, logs, numeric
  fingerprint), fix against the repro, prove it solved with before/after evidence plus
  the §12 gates, and never ask the user to retry and report back.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` §15; this commit (local).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — client — Code provenance audit (original vs game-derived)
- Did: audited `client/*.cs` + `native/camera_shim.cpp` (main `2a973a0`) and the client
  deltas of all 8 active isolation branches. Counted lines, IL/RVA citations, engine
  call sites, and data-file provenance; filed as `docs/engine_host/CLIENT_PROVENANCE.md`
  (registered in the area index).
- Evidence: 6,545 client lines total; 71 IL/RVA citations; 233 engine/API call sites;
  100% of source written by us — game-derived parts are behaviour rules (camera 23%,
  collision) + engine calls (58%) + config readers (4%) + native shim (15%); data files
  from game: `camera.json`, `scene_init_param.txt`, baked collision bins, mesh flags.
- Outcome: solved (audit), no code changes.
- Re-open: re-run after branch merges; line-level attribution would need per-hunk review.

### 2026-09-29 — engine_host — Mini sandbox client plan (small-map dev root)
- Did: measured the loop's weight (PakV4 **192.34 GB**, client root 21.62 GB,
  MovieEditor 2.46 GB) and planned a mini sandbox: sandbox asset root with its own
  `clientconfig.ini` + mini `PakV4` (or loose tree), trace-driven dependency closure,
  native repack via the engine's own `KG_PAKFS_*` write API (verified exports:
  `WriteFile`, `MakeSubPackage`, `CreateDirTree`, `EnableFileTrace`, …), and a small
  scene tier (existing `source\Map\EmptyMap`/`512Simple2`, then a 2×2 region crop of
  龙门寻宝 around region (2,2), world coords preserved).
- Evidence: `docs/engine_host/MINI_SANDBOX_CLIENT.md` (sizes, formats, exports, phases
  S0–S4); local scans + dumpbin; no install writes.
- Outcome: plan committed on `agent/mini-sandbox`; S0 (loose-map load spike) and S1
  (foreign asset root spike) are the next gates.

### 2026-09-29 — client — Mini sandbox: cropped loose map via RC_MAP (verified)
- Did: built `tools/sandbox/build_sandbox.py` (crop a real map to a loose map dir,
  world coords preserved by re-anchoring `WorldOrigin` + renaming region files) and
  verified the client loads it via `RC_MAP=<absolute path>`: InitPak 406 ms,
  LoadMap 281 ms, `TerrainSampler regions=2x2 origin=(0,0)`, real spawn
  `(23334,761,24224)`, 5351 collision instances, screenshots render the real scene.
  Client additions: `RC_PHYS_DLL` override + init/LoadMap elapsed-ms logs.
- Lesson (dead end): a custom sandbox asset root (junctions + copied configs)
  stalls `InitPak` ~181 s waiting on the StreamDownloader IPC, and **writable
  junctions leak engine writes into the install** — shader-cache files in
  `zhcn_hd\CachedShaders` (20:32:25) and a minidump in `zhcn_hd\bin64\minidump`
  (20:32:45) were written during the experiment; they cannot be undone (installs
  are read-only). Never junction writable dirs; absolute `RC_MAP` needs no root
  change at all and is the supported path.
- Evidence: `proof/sandbox/{mini_run.log,mini_00_15000ms.png,mini_01_30000ms.png,
  fingerprints.txt,map_manifest.json}`; `docs/engine_host/MINI_SANDBOX_CLIENT.md`.
- Outcome: solved. Sandbox = 21 MB loose map dir; scene load ~0.3 s.

### 2026-09-29 — client — Mini sandbox size trim: 1×1 crop, 6.5 MB (1/3)
- Did: added the 1×1 build (`--crop 2,2,1,1`, region (2,2) = the spawn region)
  and ran removal tests for the runtime file set: `heightmap/*.r32` is required
  by the renderer, `heightmap_bc/*.bch` by the physics terrain loader, and
  `blendmap_bc/*.r8` is an editor bake cache the runtime never reads. The
  builder now drops `.r8` by default (`--keep-bake-caches` keeps it). Final
  1×1 bundle: 6.5 MiB / 38 files = 32 % of the 2×2 (20.1 MiB); LoadMap 156 ms,
  spawn `(23334,761,24224)`, render verified. `run_sandbox.cmd` points at it
  and sets the title `sandbox-mini` (client derives `sandbox-<slug>` from the
  exe name per `AGENTS.md` §2.7; `RC_TITLE` overrides).
- Lesson: a spawn-height check is not enough to validate a trim — dropping
  `.r32` kept the physics height but rendered sky where the ground was; only the
  screenshot fingerprint caught it. Trim validation = screenshot + spawn + zero
  load failures in the engine log.
- Evidence: `proof/sandbox/{mini_s_run.log,mini_s_00_8000ms.png,
  map_s_manifest.json,fingerprints.txt}`; `docs/engine_host/MINI_SANDBOX_CLIENT.md`
  (size profiles + runtime file set).
- Outcome: solved. 1/3-size sandbox runs with identical terrain/props/spawn.

### 2026-09-29 — client — Quality-tier probe: no low-quality map ships
- Did: probed the `.jsonmap`-declared quality sets (`hd/bd/bddnc/mb/low`) for
  龙门寻宝 — 32 candidate paths across the non-HD sets returned only
  `bd/env_probe/skybox_s.dds`. `MapList.tab` has no quality variants (296/676/677
  → same jsonmap; 297 is the night map). The HD client loads the root HD set;
  `bd/` extras it asks for (`focus_face_env_params.json`,
  `volumetricCloud.json`) are absent in the install and non-fatal. No
  lower-quality map exists to shrink the sandbox with.
- Evidence: probe output (extractor, read-only); `MapList.tab` rows;
  full-client engine log `KG3D_Engine_2026_09_29_21_42_17.log` paths.
- Outcome: solved (answered); documented in `MINI_SANDBOX_CLIENT.md` §Quality tiers.

### 2026-09-29 — client — Startup cost is engine pre-draw, not the map
- Did: measured launch→playable for the sandbox (26.8 s) and broke down the
  engine log: `Init3DEngine` 24.4 s, of which ~22 s is
  `KG3D_Engine::StartPreDrawShader` (`预渲染总开关:开启`); `LoadMap` is only
  0.17 s. Root cause of the 22 s: `data/public/PreDrawSetting.ini` ships
  `ShouldPreDraw=1` + `PreDrawThreadMaxNum=1`; this machine's GPU score is
  61656 vs the 10257 threshold, but the one-thread cap is what makes the
  warm-up slow. Full client pays the same 24 s; the sandbox cannot change it.
- Lesson: engine init is a fixed host cost (~24 s) — scene cropping only cuts
  map load (1.6 s → 0.17 s) and memory. Faster startup requires overriding
  `PreDrawSetting.ini` (pak, install read-only) via a writable root (InitPak
  stall) or an engine-level bypass — both open research items.
- Evidence: `docs/engine_host/MINI_SANDBOX_CLIENT.md` §Startup breakdown;
  engine log `KG3D_Engine_2026_09_29_21_54_26.log`; extracted
  `PreDrawSetting.ini`; `_PreDrawMachineInfo.txt`.
- Outcome: explained; no fix applied (would need install write — forbidden).

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Merge mini-sandbox into main + naming alignment
- Did: merged `agent/mini-sandbox` (`f3e9511`) — union-resolved the window-title hunk
  (main derivation + `RC_TITLE` override), kept both experience-log entry sets and both
  `docs/engine_host/README.md` rows/tools table. Post-merge: `run_sandbox.cmd` builds
  and launches `reborn_client_mini.exe` (title `sandbox-mini`; `RC_TITLE` dropped),
  MINI doc updated, `build_sandbox.py` derives extractor/pak from `--client-root`
  (dead constants removed). Rebuilt canonical client (`exit=0`); `camera_smoke.exe`
  ALL PASS; bin64 `reborn_client_pure.exe` leftovers removed.
- Evidence: merge `f3e9511`; `client\build_client.cmd` exit=0; `camera_smoke.exe` ALL PASS.
- Outcome: solved. `main` local-only ahead of origin (no push).

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Rule: local-first (no server-side excuses)
- Did: `AGENTS.md` §4 now requires local-first research: whatever the game needs exists
  in the client/MovieEditor installs (prediction, UI data, tables, configs, formats);
  "it comes from the server / we cannot find it" is not an acceptable answer, and a
  server-side claim needs a cited client-side counterpart. Mirrored in
  `tools/netcode/AGENTS.md`.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` §4; `tools/netcode/AGENTS.md`; this commit (local).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Rule: closing game-design check answers "Yes"
- Did: wording change in `AGENTS.md` §15 — the mandatory closing check now reads
  "Does this follow the client's own truth - no invented fixes or band-aids? **Yes** -
  we connect the real game engines and reproduce the original game design; nothing was
  invented or band-aided around." A provisional deviation must still be named explicitly
  (a "Yes" must never hide it). Reason: the old "No" answer read as if something was
  wrong, while it was intended to mean "no invented fixes".
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` §15; this commit (local).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — client — Collision + camera-wall-clip merge review (offline gates run)
- Did: full check of `agent/collision-improvement` (39 commits, 26 files) and
  `agent/camera-wall-clip` (15 commits, 17 files) vs main. Preflight conflicts are narrow:
  `client/RebornClient.cs` + `docs/EXPERIENCES.md` (camera adds `client/build_client.cmd`).
  Built and ran each branch's offline gate from detached temp worktrees (no shared-state
  writes): **collision selftest 19/19 PASS**, **camera smoke ALL PASS** (operation modes +
  obstruction rules).
- Evidence: temp-worktree builds/runs; `git merge-tree` preflight; branch logs.
- Outcome: both merge-worthy; recommended order camera first, then collision; held because
  both agent worktrees are dirty (collision 6 files, camera 3 files) - merge when the
  subjects are committed/clean (or accept the tips as-is).
- Re-open: merge + post-merge gates (collision 19/19, camera smoke, live T1/door spot).

### 2026-09-29 — client — Merge camera-wall-clip (camera pen v3) into main
- Did: merged `agent/camera-wall-clip` @ `0a8d60b` (`d450ba6`). Conflicts resolved: window
  title kept main's `sandbox-<slug>` derivation (branch's hardcoded "Camera Pen v3"
  dropped; `RC_TITLE` can reproduce it), `build_client.cmd` kept main's feature-build
  contract, `EXPERIENCES.md` = main's entries + the branch's 300 added lines. Client
  rebuilt (`exit=0`); camera smoke ALL PASS; shim source compiles with
  `RC_D6Seed`/`RC_D6Dbg`/`RC_Shim` exports verified via a temp build.
- Blocked: bin64 `camera_shim.dll` rebuild (activates the D6 seed) while three agent
  clients hold the DLL (`reborn_client_campen_v3`, `reborn_client_collision`,
  `reborn_client_ww_sandbox`) - run `native\build_shim.cmd` once they close.
- Evidence: merge `d450ba6`; temp shim export check; `camera_smoke.exe` ALL PASS.
- Outcome: merged (local only); D6 fix pending the shim rebuild.

### 2026-09-30 — client — Merge double-jump into main (二段跳 flip + calibration + S6 steering)
- Did: merged `agent/double-jump` (`7f06700`). Conflicts resolved: `RebornClient.cs` via
  `git merge-file --ours` (auto-merged jump code kept; `selfSlug` restored for the
  per-workstream config dir), `build_client.cmd` kept main's feature-build contract
  (branch's per-slug config copies dropped), `EXPERIENCES.md` = main's + 5 branch
  entries. Client rebuilt (`exit=0`); camera smoke ALL PASS; `tools/gravity/verify_model.py`
  passes (J1 default row; J0 1.92 m calibration); live run logs
  `jump: mode=flip school=0 scale=0.520 (apex 191u ~ 191cm per jump)`.
- Evidence: merge `7f06700`; `build_info.txt` git=7f06700; `reborn_20260930_132754.log`.
- Outcome: solved (local only).

### 2026-09-30 — repo — Aborted a wrong-branch merge (ww-sandbox) — ask, never infer
- Did: started merging `feature/ww-sandbox` into main based on inference from its
  "sandbox port notes"; the user stopped it — that branch was not requested.
  `git merge --abort` restored main to `765447f` (clean); the branch/worktree untouched.
- Evidence: `git status -sb` -> `## main...origin/main`; `git log -1` -> `765447f`.
- Outcome: solved (no harm). Lesson: when the branch choice is ambiguous, ask and wait —
  never infer the target from branch content.

### 2026-09-30 — repo — Rule: feature title mandatory on every client update
- Did: strengthened `AGENTS.md` §2.7 — every client update for a feature must set the
  top-left window title to that feature (`reborn_client_<slug>.exe` -> `sandbox-<slug>`;
  sandboxes `sandbox-ability`/`sandbox-asset`; `RC_TITLE=<feature>` overrides one-off
  canonical runs). Identical titles across client windows are a rule violation.
  Mirrored in `client/AGENTS.md`.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` §2.7; `client/AGENTS.md`; this commit (local).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-30 — repo — Rule: blocked client start must name the conflicting session
- Did: `AGENTS.md` §2.4 now requires that when a client start is blocked by the
  single-instance/namespace guard, the response must end by naming the conflicting
  session — process name, PID, start time and namespace — so the user knows which
  window/session to close. Mirrored in `client/AGENTS.md`.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` §2.4; `client/AGENTS.md`; this commit (local).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — penetration research inventory + main-tip drift audit
- Did: read the camera docs set (`PENETRATION_PLAN`, `WALL_OBSTRUCTION`,
  `HANDOFF`, `HOST_DEVIATIONS`, `COMPLETION_PLAN`, `CLOSE_RANGE_RESEARCH`,
  `FIX_SUGGESTIONS`, `CONFORMANCE_CHECKS`), the camera git history
  (`bdfb586`..`3fd31b4`), and the live code camera block (`RebornClient.cs`,
  `CameraSystem.CameraObstruction`, `FoliageCollision.Raycast`). Confirmed main
  carries the engine look-at/absolute-Y path (D3/B6 closed), 5/9 probes with
  the per-mesh `.cflags` gate, NoCross/scene-min/degenerate-hit guards and the
  `RC_CAM_PENDBG` recorder. Drifts found: (1) the live default
  `RC_CAM_HITWIN`/`RC_CAM_HITWINDOW` is `0`, so B11 hit stabilization is OFF on
  main although `PENETRATION_PLAN` C1d and `HOST_DEVIATIONS` B11 say 0.25 s
  default-on (all added in the `3fd31b4` WIP checkpoint); (2) `docs/controls/
  CONTROLS_GAP_REGISTER.md` S9 and `docs/camera/CONFORMANCE_CHECKS.md` still
  describe the pre-obstruction state; (3) generated foliage bins + `.cflags`
  remain tracked under `engine_host_spike/collision_data`.
- Side-job queue (from `PENETRATION_PLAN`): P0 recorder audit on T1-T4 with the
  current build; P4 missing drawn classes (landscape/bd/subscene -> camera-only
  FCOL); P2 probe footprint (blocked, live host recon); P5 band-aid removal
  after the audit.
- Evidence: `git merge-base --is-ancestor 3fd31b4 main` -> true;
  `client/RebornClient.cs:429,1854,1941`; `client/FoliageCollision.cs:452`.
- Outcome: partial (research done, fix queue defined, drifts not yet fixed).

### 2026-09-29 — camera — T1 penetration root cause: front-only probes; double-sided fix landed
**Problem:** after the engine look-at/guard work the user still reported wall
penetration. The Step-1 recorder had never been run over the T1 sweep, and the
T1 cavity (`18985,682,24515`) is the original user spot.
**Tried:** built the workstream client `reborn_client_camclip.exe` (and first
fixed `client/build_client.cmd` to honor the AGENTS §2 `RC_CLIENT_EXE`
contract it claimed to implement), re-ran the T1 demo sweep with
`RC_CAM_PENDBG=1`, then A/B'd the front-only probe filter and the hit window.
**Outcome:** solved (fix landed, default on).
**Why:** main-tip defaults produced 18 event lines / 192 event-frames at T1:
the resolved camera sat on the far side of rock shell inst 897 (reverse bake
hit 1-2 u from the camera) and of scene-only geometry (reverse scene hit 6-11 u,
bake clear) while the forward front-face-only probes were blind - once the
camera slips past a surface whose front faces it, the forward query can never
see it again and the spring returns through the geometry. A/B: front-only
192 frames; front-only + hit-window(0.25 s) 118; **double-sided 0**.
`RC_CAM_BACKFACE` now defaults on (`=0` restores front-only), registered as
B14 with the real `FilterCamera` (D1) winding rule as the exit. Exact
regressions: T2 `hit=206 len=188`, T4 `hit=186 len=168`, T1 `hit=11 len=0`,
userspot idle pull 155 (`hit=173`) 0 jumps, 45 s route 0 events/jumps,
camera_smoke ALL PASS, exit 0/DONE.
Also corrected a doc/code drift: B11 hit stabilization is opt-in on main
(`RC_CAM_HITWIN` default 0), not the C1d "shipped 0.25".
**Re-open criteria:** the native `FilterCamera` winding rule is recovered, or
double-sided probes cause over-pulling somewhere (kill switch `RC_CAM_BACKFACE=0`).
**Links:** `docs/camera/PENETRATION_PLAN.md` progress log 2026-09-29 (camclip);
`docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` B11/B14; logs `reborn_20260929_122635`
(before) and `_123534`/`_123619`/`_123704`/`_123851`/`_123947` (after) in
`bin64\reborn_out`.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — client-truth max defaults (follow distance 2000 u, 广角 60°)
- Did: user decision "default both to true max = client truth": the character
  follow distance default moved from the invented 6 m placeholder to **2000 u
  (20 m)** - the client's own maximum (`VideoSettingPanel.fMaxCameraDistance`
  default 2000, engine cap 2000, `JX3RepresentX64` const blob `0x180d2af90`);
  广角 default stays the client's panel maximum **60°** (log source renamed
  `client-max-default`; the engine `fMaxCameraAngle` cap is not recoverable in
  this install). Also carried the session build tag (`Camera Pen v3`) and the
  `obstdbg` instance/flag logging.
- Evidence: `client/camera.json` character row, `CameraSystem.cs:101/129/142`,
  `RebornClient.cs:488/889`, `VideoSettings.cs`,
  `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` C6/C10;
  `camera_smoke_wallclip.exe` **ALL PASS (26 checks**, incl. the new
  "distance default = client max 2000 u"); live log
  `reborn_20260929_162023.log`: `CameraSystem ready: ... dist=2000u`,
  `fov source=... angle=60.00`.
- Outcome: solved. Committed on `agent/camera-wall-clip`; **not pushed** (new
  main rule `ff67fff`: never push unless explicitly asked). The per-slug test
  client picks the config from `bin64\reborn_campen_v3\camera.json`.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — "zooms in while turning, returns when I stop" (B15)
**Problem:** user report: pressing W (running a slope/turning) the camera
continuously zoomed in "for no reason", then sprang back to the 2000 u default
after stopping.
**Tried:** reproduced with `RC_CAM_DEBUG/SHAKEDBG/OBSTDBG/PENDBG` (log
`reborn_20260929_163131`): the penetration recorder showed **0 events** and
`betweendbg` clear, `hit=-1` on every frame of the burst - so the pull was not
geometry. `jumpdbg` showed `offLen` collapsing 2050 -> 1520 u in ~60 ms at a
fast camera flick, then recovering over ~3 s.
**Outcome:** solved (fix landed in code; live feel check pending).
**Why:** the per-axis SmoothTime smoothing of the *rotating* orbit offset
shortens the vector through its chord; the obstruction state machine received
that shortened `offLen` as its desired length and, since `target < Distance`
applies immediately (the engine's no-threshold shortening rule), snapped the
camera in - then the 1.5/2.828 flex eased it back over seconds. Fix: probes +
`CameraObstruction` now use the **raw desired offset** (the candidate line the
engine queries); the per-axis smoothing stays once, on the resolved offset
(`rSm`). The double `camOffSmooth` stage was removed.
**Re-open criteria:** a fast flick still produces a resolved-length jump in
`jumpdbg` (`smstep` > 2 u), or the T2/T4 obstruction invariants drift.
**Links:** `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` B15; logs `_163131` (before),
`_165430` (after); `client/RebornClient.cs`.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — "still happens": sprint row still targeted 6 m
- Did: user retest still showed "press W (Shift) -> camera zooms in, stop ->
  back". Log `reborn_20260929_165430` camdbg: `mode=sprint dist=1334 -> 905 ->
  660`, then `mode=character dist=1995` - the **sprint row** still carried the
  old 6 m placeholder, so Shift+W ramped the distance target 2000 -> 660 and
  back. (The B15 fix is visible in the same log: during a ~7 rad/s flick the
  raw `offLen` moves but the smoothed camera `sm` stays ~2018, no collapse.)
- Fix: sprint row `TargetDistance`/`InitCameraDistance` = 20 m in
  `camera.json` + `CameraSystem.DefaultRow`, same client-truth max as the
  character row. The sprint pull-back (+60 u) clamps at the 2000 u max.
- Evidence: `reborn_20260929_171501` (`CameraSystem ready: ... dist=2000u`),
  `camera_smoke_wallclip` ALL PASS. Outcome: solved pending user feel check.

### 2026-09-29 — controls — operation-modes implementation plan (CLASSICAL/JOYSTICK)
- Did: wrote `docs/controls/OPERATION_MODES_PLAN.md` (registered in the
  controls index): game truth per mode, input routing matrix, switch key
  (`F7` host + `RC_MODE` env; the real client switches via the
  `UISetting_Operation_Switch` panel and has no default hotkey), per-mode
  settings (`nCameraModeInClassicMode/JoystickMode`), phases P0-P4 and tests.
  Found that the client already has a partial joystick branch keyed off the
  **wrong** setting (`tCameraStatic.nCameraMode == 1`, the follow mode, at
  `RebornClient.cs:806-823`) - P1 moves it onto an explicit `OperationMode`.
- Evidence: `docs/controls/JX3_CAMERA_CONTROLS.md` §3,
  `controls/RESEARCH_RESOLVED_GAPS.md` §4-5,
  `proof/controls/ui_lua/OperationSwitch.joystick.txt`,
  `hotkeys_script.dump.txt`.
- Outcome: plan committed; implementation starts at P0 on request.
- Re-open: implement P0 when the user picks it up (no code changes yet).

### 2026-09-29 — controls — operation modes P0-P2 landed (F7 switch)
- Did: implemented the plan: `CameraOperationMode` pure gating model +
  `CameraSettings.OperationMode` with `RC_MODE`, `F7` toggle (host key; real
  client switches via the UI panel), `op=` in `camdbg`, `OPMODE=` fingerprint;
  moved the always-rotate/cursor-lock branch off `tCameraStatic.nCameraMode`
  onto the operation mode; joystick disables the RMB body-turn (body follows
  the movement heading). Per-mode follow values (`nCameraModeIn*Mode`) are
  parsed + logged; applying them and the turn-rate model stay open (P2/P3
  partial). Controls register C12 -> PARTIAL.
- Evidence: `client/CameraSystem.cs` (`CameraOperationMode`),
  `client/CameraSettings.cs`, `client/RebornClient.cs`;
  `camera_smoke_wallclip` ALL PASS (29 checks: mode gating + parse);
  `RC_MODE=joystick` run `reborn_20260929_175413.log` (`op=joystick`, DONE,
  exit 0); test client rebuilt (`reborn_client_campen_v3.exe`, merged tree +
  ported edits, log `reborn_20260929_175819.log`, `OPMODE=classical`).
- Outcome: P0-P2 solved (P2 partial), P3 partial, P4 open.
- Re-open: turn-rate model + follow-mode semantics + reset-speed application.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — default follow distance corrected to 1245 u (cap vs initial)
**Problem:** after the "max default" change the camera terrain-pulled constantly
("zooms in for no reason"): `jumpdbg src=[probe4 ... terr=1934->1365]`,
`obstdbg probe0 ... terr=671` at rest, `clamp=1` - the native 5-probe query
pulling because a 2000 u camera sits at ground level behind the player.
**Tried:** traced the original game's distance sources in the disassembly and
shipped data instead of guessing again.
**Outcome:** solved (default changed to 1245 u; exact initial value still not
provable from local data).
**Why:** `fMaxCameraDistance` (default 2000, custom.dat) is only the zoom-out
cap - `SetCameraMaxDistance` `0x180ace520` clamps and writes the camera node's
cap field `+0x74`/`+0x8C`, never the current distance. The character camera
reads **no** `InitCameraDistance` (string xrefs only in the air-combat
`0x180ac9db5` and carrier `0x180b1c876` loaders). The distance is not persisted
either (`g_Scene_tCameraRuntime` = yaw/pitch/eyeScale only). The only shipped
camera-distance number is `number.krl CameraMaxDistance = 1245 u`, loaded into
`CommonNumber+0x98`; no reader of that field was located in this build (same
as the documented legacy `NearByWallDistance`), so 1245 is the best
client-authored value but the exact initial distance remains unproven until
the CDN `camera_common.krl.txt` row is obtained.
**Re-open criteria:** a `CommonNumber+0x98` reader is found (proves/refutes
1245), or the CDN per-mode row arrives.
**Links:** `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` C10; `proof/netcode/disasm/
camera_maxdistance_xrefs.txt` (loader store at `+0x98`),
`camera_sLoad_calls.txt`, `camera_wall_obstruction.txt` §11;
`proof/gravity/number.krl.txt`. Code: `camera.json` (character + sprint rows),
`CameraSystem.cs`, `CameraSmoke.cs` (`distance default = client number 1245 u`),
live log `reborn_20260929_181215.log` (before), `camera_smoke_wallclip` ALL
PASS after.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — close-camera character hide threshold (B1 fix)
**Problem:** user report: dragging the camera up close shows the **inside of
the character**; the game hides/fades the character at some point (like "too
close") instead.
**Tried:** re-read the original-design evidence (`CLOSE_RANGE_RESEARCH.md` §2:
no explicit hide in the camera path; the effect is view near-plane clipping +
the engine's model fade, measured at camLen ~36..96 u in HANDOFF §4) and
inspected the host park-below hack.
**Outcome:** solved (threshold fixed; true exit remains the near-plane setter).
**Why:** the hack hid the dummy when camera->chest-anchor distance < **90 u** -
exactly the head offset (~90 u above the chest anchor). A camera sitting inside
the head hovers at camDist ~90, so the hide never fired and the inside stayed
visible. Raised the hide threshold to **105 u** (restore still >150 u) and added
`hideNear hide/show camDist=` logs. Host approximation registered under B1.
**Re-open criteria:** the view near-plane setter lands (C7/B1 exit) and the
park-below hack can be deleted.
**Links:** `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` B1; `docs/camera/CLOSE_RANGE_RESEARCH.md`
§2; HANDOFF §4 ladder; test client `reborn_client_campen_v3.exe`
(`6b55d5b+modes+hide105`, log `reborn_20260929_203437.log`).

### 2026-09-29 — engine — D6 trampoline verdict: BEX64 side effect even single-instance
- Did: the test client ran with `RC_PATCH_D6=1` (single instance, `patchD6 rc=0
  cave=0000000170EE0000`); while walking "down" the app died. Event log:
  `c0000005`, **module unknown**, fault offset `0x7FFE70EE0000` - the documented
  BEX64 jump-to-data pattern (earlier occurrence `0x7FFE622B0000` with three
  overlapping clients), i.e. the bail path's skipped cleanup corrupting state.
- Evidence: Windows Application Error event; run log
  `reborn_20260929_203437.log` (idle at 20:43 before the fault);
  `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` D6 updated.
- Outcome: the trampoline trades D6 for a rarer but fake crash; it stays
  **off by default** and must not be re-enabled until the bail path is fixed
  (proper local cleanup) or the missing editor DataStores/material root cause
  is fixed. Test client restarted with `PATCH_D6=0` (log
  `reborn_20260929_204449.log`).
- Re-open: fix the trampoline's bail path, or isolate/preconvert the missing
  materials (D6 exit).

### 2026-09-29 — engine — D6 dump analysis + hide-thrash correlation
- Did: parsed the WER crash dump
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps\reborn_client_campen_v3.exe.30400.dmp` with a new
  stdlib tool (`tools/camera/minidump_exc.py`, registered in the camera README).
- Found: fault `KG3DEngineDX11EX64+0x11D03B6`, **`rsi=0`** (the null
  material/store pointer), worker thread `tid 36460`; stack candidates inside
  `KG3DEngineDX11EX64` (e.g. `+0x1F6D790`, `+0xBF77A0`, `+0x745A89`) and the
  editor host wrappers `KG_EngineEditorX64+0x26F6B/+0x2725E`; no asset path on
  the stack (register pointers are objects, not strings).
- Log correlation: in the seconds before the fault the camera was at extreme
  pitch (`-1.553`) pulled to 70 u, and `hideNear` **thrashed**
  (`hide 104.9 -> show 150.1 -> hide 105.0 -> show 150.5`); every `show`
  re-adds the dummy model, i.e. engine content churn on the streamed-content
  path that AVs.
- Mitigation: show threshold 150 -> **250** (hide 105 unchanged) to cut the
  churn; D6 root cause (missing editor DataStores / null material) stays open.
- Evidence: log `reborn_20260929_204449.log` (+ hide lines), tool output saved
  in the session; new build `reborn_client_campen_v3.exe` (log
  `reborn_20260929_205411.log`). Outcome: partial (risk reduced, root open).

### 2026-09-29 — camera — faithful-mechanism recon for close-camera hiding
**Problem:** the user called out the park-below threshold tuning as a band-aid;
the real game uses the view near plane + engine model fade (CLOSE_RANGE_RESEARCH
§2), so find an engine-authored mechanism instead of tuning thresholds.
**Tried:** (a) dumped the managed wrapper API (`RC_API_DUMP`): only
`KGEngineCLR.SetMainPlayerType/GetMainPlayerType` exist, no near-plane/visibility
API; (b) A/B `SetMainPlayerType(0/1)` at T1 with park-below off and the camera
pulled to len=0 - the engine culls the character identically in both, and the
one crash seen in the first mp0 run did not reproduce (3 runs each, all exit 0);
(c) engine exports: `KG3D_SceneObject::SetPlayerObject/IsPlayerObject` /
`SetMainCharactor`, camera-property schema `NearPlane/FarPlane/
AutoComputeClipPanes` (consumed by `KG3D_Engine::CreateCamera`), no near-plane
setter export.
**Outcome:** partial - the main-player route is not the mechanism; the near
plane remains the faithful target (camera/view vtable projection block).
**Why:** the engine already culls the model at len=0 natively; the residual
"see inside" band is where the host approximation sits.
**Re-open criteria:** locate the camera/view projection near-plane field or the
`KG3D_CAMERA_PROPERTY` write path, then delete B1.
**Links:** `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` B1; harness knobs
`RC_API_DUMP`, `RC_MAINPLAYER`, `RC_CAM_PITCH/RC_CAM_YAW`
(`client/RebornClient.cs`); A/B screenshots `%TEMP%\campen_ab\t1_mp{0,1}.png`.

### 2026-09-29 — engine — D6 root cause pinned: missing `RCPI_Scene` registry entry
**Problem:** the user crashed again (same D6 `+0x11D03B6`) after running ~4 s
and stopping with the camera <105 u; asked to reproduce and find the cause.
**Tried:** WER dump `...30272.dmp` -> `tools/camera/minidump_exc.py`; then full
`dumpbin /disasm` of `KG3DEngineDX11EX64.dll` and targeted decompilation of the
faulting function.
**Outcome:** root cause identified (fix path clear, not yet implemented).
**Why:** fault function RVA `0x11CE760` (worker/streaming path) lazily FNV-hashes
the named context string **`RCPI_Scene`** (RVA `0x21CB2A8`), looks it up in a
global registry, and on lookup failure stores `rsi=0` then dereferences without
a null check (`mov rbx,[rsi]` at `+0x11D03B6`). The editor host's registry lacks
that entry - the documented missing build-machine content. The in-function
failure cleanup at `0x1811D0778` frees locals that are not yet initialized at
the crash point, so the old trampoline (skip-to-epilogue) was guaranteed to
corrupt (BEX64).
**Re-open criteria:** locate the `RCPI_Scene` registrar (or trigger its
creation) and init it in the host; otherwise write a patch that performs the
function's own partial cleanup before returning failure.
**Links:** `proof/netcode/disasm/d6_rcpi_scene.txt`; `docs/camera/
HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` D6; dump `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps\reborn_client_campen_v3.exe.30272.dmp`;
`tools/camera/minidump_exc.py`.

### 2026-09-29 — engine — D6 FIXED: seed the engine's uncomputed `RCPI_Scene` hash
**Problem:** the app kept AVing at `KG3DEngineDX11EX64+0x11D03B6` (`rsi=0`) in
interactive play; earlier work only diagnosed it (missing `RCPI_Scene`
registry lookup).
**Tried:** (a) live-context VEH in `camera_shim.dll` (`RC_D6DBG=1`) that dumps
registers + the registry graph at the exact fault site; (b) a synthetic input
driver (`tools/camera/drive_client.ps1`) to reproduce the interaction-only
crash unattended; (c) seed the engine's lazy hash value from the shim.
**Outcome:** solved (default-on).
**Why:** the VEH capture showed `[rbp-70h]=0` at the crash - the engine's
per-function lazy FNV-1 hash of `RCPI_Scene` (slot `base+0x2D5BBD0`) was never
computed: the guard gate `cmp [guard], tls; jg init` (`0x1811D0335`) let the
worker through before the init ran, so the map lookup used key 0 and the
null result was dereferenced without a check. `camera_shim.dll` now writes the
exact hash the engine's own loop would compute (`0x392E0BFA0428F080`) into the
slot at load (`RC_D6Seed`, no code patch, `RC_D6SEED=0` opts out).
**Evidence:** driven interactive A/B at the crash spot: baseline
(`RC_D6SEED=0`) **2/2 crashes** with `key=0` captures; seeded **2/2 alive**
(240 s and 200 s driver runs).
**Re-open criteria:** a crash at another lazy-hash site (VEH will capture it),
or the engine's own init starts running (verified build).
**Links:** `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` D6; `native/camera_shim.cpp`
(`RC_D6Seed`/`RC_D6Dbg`); `tools/camera/drive_client.ps1`;
`tools/camera/minidump_exc.py`.

### 2026-09-29 — movement — 二段跳 research + client jump chain (reborn_client_double_jump)
- Did: decoded the double-jump press model from `KCharacter::Jump` (chain gate
  `jumpCount >= MaxJumpCount[school]` 0x140313B19, row = current count at
  0x140313B20, Represent `DOUBLE_JUMP` state + `GetDoubleJumpEndOffset`),
  extracted the full per-school chain (`--chain`; J0 invariant 40,90,11, J1 is
  the 二段跳 signature, gravity clamp 0..31 matters for schools 10/11),
  reproduced it in `client/JumpTable.cs` + RebornClient (J0 unchanged, J1+ per
  press, landing reset, reject log), and added isolated feature-build naming
  (`RC_CLIENT_EXE`, own memory namespace + guard, per-exe build_info).
- Evidence: `tools/gravity/parse_jump_tables.py --chain`; verify_model §6;
  in-engine runs in `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` (A/C clean:
  `djb press n=2` -> `djb land n=2` -> DONE; B/D reproduce the
  `f1b02yd二段跳a.tani` AV, so the tani is opt-in and the client defaults to the
  jump clip); commits `e261499`, `c937973`.
- Outcome: solved. Open: segment-end End-triple trigger, JumpFrameParam curves,
  fly-state re-press path, tani AV.

### 2026-09-29 — movement — 二段跳 corrected: flip mode (user feedback), tani vs ani
- Did: user reported the chain-mode double jump (J1 ballistic, 11.7 m) as "way
  too high / wrong action". Confirmed via MIN2 that the jump clips are in-place
  (bip01 Y=0 all frames), so the arc is physics; the J1 row is the 轻功 flight
  chain and its takeoff-burst/End-phase trigger is still undecoded. Implemented
  the plain 二段跳 as `RC_DJUMP=flip` (provisional): the air press re-uses the
  J0 triple (one extra normal jump, max 2) and plays the authored
  `f1b02yd二段跳a.ani`; kept the raw table chain as `RC_DJUMP=chain` for research.
- Evidence: `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` run E (exit 0; press n=2
  at first-jump apex y=1008 -> land y=646, ~1.9 m extra; `clip -> ...二段跳a.ani
  (0)`; reject n=3), runs B/D (tani wrapper AV 0xC0000005). Doc §1/§4/§5 updated.
- Outcome: solved provisionally; re-open when the `ModifySprintEndSpeed` trigger
  is decoded (then use J1 burst + End triple instead of the J0 re-use).

### 2026-09-29 — movement — 二段跳 unit calibration: RC_JUMP_SCALE=0.52
- Did: user still reported the flip jump as "way too high" and asked to make the
  unit research work. Per `UNIT_SCALE_AND_CHARACTER_SIZE.md` / `JX3_COLLISION_SYSTEM.md`
  G-0 (canonical 1 u = 1 cm), the raw `J0` triple gives a 368 u = 3.68 m apex,
  ~2x the spec's in-game 1.92 m (`REBORN_JUMP_FALL_SPEC.md`; MapSpike used
  `703 u/s`, `1289 u/s^2`). Added `RC_JUMP_SCALE` (default 0.52 = 100/192)
  scaling takeoff AND gravity together, so `J0` realises 1.92 m with the 1.09 s
  air time; applies to flip and chain modes.
- Evidence: `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` run F (exit 0):
  `jump: mode=flip school=0 scale=0.520 (apex 191u)`; press n=2 at y=835 after
  press n=1 at y=646 (191 u = 1.91 m); double-jump apex ~3.8 m. Client log line
  added at startup.
- Outcome: solved. Raw-table mode still available with `RC_JUMP_SCALE=1`.

### 2026-09-29 — client — standing-jump stutter: model transform gate ignored Y
- Did: user reported a stationary jump stutters/"sticks in the middle" (both
  jumps), while holding W looked correct. Root cause: the model-update gate
  (`RebornClient.cs`) only re-placed the dummy when X/Z or yaw changed, so a
  standing jump (py only) never moved the model; with W held the X/Z deltas
  masked it. Added Y to the gate + `lastModelY`, and an apex sample log
  (`djb apex n= py= modelY=`) so the fix is numerically checkable.
- Evidence: `proof/gravity/double_jump_reborn_run.txt` run G (exit 0):
  `djb apex n=2 py=1023 modelY=1022` (model tracks physics; before the fix the
  model stayed at the y=646 takeoff height).
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — controls — camera-relative steering + turn model (S6), client renamed
- Did: user reported RMB drag could not turn the character while walking. Per the
  control notes (`JX3_MOVEMENT_CONTROLS.md` §2; `CAMERAORSELECTORMOVESTICKY`
  rotates camera **and** character; gap register S6) the client held the world
  direction while the key set was unchanged, so camera rotation never steered.
  Removed the latch (movement direction recomputed camera-relative every frame),
  added the `RunTo` turn model (heading vs facing; facing turns at the π rad/s
  host fallback; a >112.5° turn halves speed and turn step), reused the rate in
  the RMB turn, and renamed the feature build to
  `reborn_client_double_jump_control.exe`.
- Evidence: `proof/controls/steering_run.txt` (demo camera orbit at t=6s:
  `dir=(0,1)` → `(0.78,0.62)`, `yaw` 0.00 → 0.90, path curves; exit 0);
  `CONTROLS_GAP_REGISTER.md` S6 → DONE; `JX3_MOVEMENT_CONTROLS.md` §6 updated.
- Outcome: solved for the steering rule; the server `+0x48` per-frame turn step
  is still undecoded (host π rad/s fallback documented).
