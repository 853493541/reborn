# Experiences log

Append-only record of the development process: what we tried, what broke, how we
solved it, and what is still open. **Newest at the bottom.**

## How to use this file

- Append a **compact entry** after every work-bearing response/session (investigation,
  code change, decision). Pure Q&A does not need one.
- Use the **full template** for notable lessons, dead ends, non-obvious fixes, or
  locked decisions.
- Never edit or delete past entries; a correction is a new entry.
- Every entry links its evidence (paths, commands, commits) and carries a confidence
  when the outcome is uncertain.
- A dead end must include date, scope, and re-open criteria — never "we tried stuff".

## Legacy experience records

- `engine_host_spike/EXPERIENCE_MAP_SPIKE.md` — Spike B: hosting the MovieEditor map
  display (2026-09-21). Lessons still valid: IL recon first, adopt the editor's exact
  order/values, numeric fingerprints for visual checks, engine-run costs.
- `_port_from_mapviewer/EXPERIENCES.md` — removed in cleanup (commit `f92139d`).
  Recoverable from git history if needed; its theory is banned anyway (AGENTS.md §7).

## Entries

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Agent rules + experience log setup
- Did: wrote root `AGENTS.md` (merged with the existing `#iso` workflow) covering
  lookup protocol, `interface\` rule, no-invented-fixes, map-viewer disposition,
  locked constraints, legacy table, area map, stack, gates, and hard rules; created
  this experience log; appended recall pointers in `SFX_GROUND_RULES.md`; rewrote
  `README.md` as the human entry point; added nested `AGENTS.md` files under
  `engine_host_spike/`, `client/`, `tools/netcode/`, `ui-process-app/`, `native/`.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md`, this file, commits on `cleanup/repo-tidy`.
- Outcome: solved

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Consolidation + cleanup (merge, naming, launcher, Desktop)
- Did: merged all 8 branches into `main` (union-resolved the anim-picker/ability-sandbox
  split; pushed `30d9178`). On `cleanup/repo-tidy`: removed the web viewer and probes
  (`map-ui-explorer`, `web/`, Playwright/three.js leftovers), `_port_from_mapviewer`/
  `_ref_chrome`, unused `ability_sandbox/cam`, legacy `engine_host_spike` hosts and the
  actor-map spike; retired `map-ui-app` (text assets → `ui-process-app/Data/text`);
  renamed `reborn_camfp.exe` → `reborn_client.exe` and rebuilt; repurposed `app/`
  launcher to start `reborn_client.exe` (+`RC_MAP` picker) and fixed its Desktop
  shortcut; removed dead JX3 Ani Player leftovers (`player.py` gone since `17385ae`);
  untracked generated per-map structure bins; dropped the redundant 90 MB samples zip;
  consolidated the Desktop to one folder (`_backup/` moved inside, ignored); untracked
  local runtime state (`perf_config.ini`, `launch_*.txt`) per AGENTS.md §9.
- Evidence: commits `30d9178`, `4816d46`..`12d1a81`; `git status` clean; rebuilt
  `bin64\reborn_client.exe` (build_info git id); `_backup\reborn-all-refs.bundle`.
- Outcome: solved. `cleanup/repo-tidy` is ahead of `main`, not merged yet.
- Re-open: merge `cleanup/repo-tidy` → `main` and push; delete `_backup/` after.

### 2026-09-29 — docs — Note inventory + netcode index registration
- Did: inventoried tracked notes (**143 `.md`**: `docs/` 69, `proof/` 30, root 28
  (24 player-era), `engine_host_spike/` 5, tools/apps 10); audited the area indexes
  (`docs/controls` 9/9, `docs/pvp` 2/2, `docs/netcode` 17/21) and registered the four
  missing 绝境 mode notes (`JX3_MODE_GAP_REGISTER`, `JX3_MODE_JUEJING`,
  `JX3_MODE_JUEJING_LOGIC`, `JX3_MODE_LOAD_FLOW`) in `docs/netcode/README.md` (§13).
- Evidence: `git ls-files "*.md"`; index audit command; this commit.
- Outcome: solved. `docs/netcode` is now 21/21 registered.

### 2026-09-29 — docs — Reorganize docs into area folders + indexes
- Did: moved the 32 remaining `docs/` root notes into `docs/camera/` (18, `CAMERA_`
  prefix dropped), `docs/movement/` (7), `docs/engine_host/` (3), `docs/ui/` (2),
  `docs/audio/` (1) and `docs/controls/` (+`PLAYER_CONTROLS_FINDINGS.md`); swept all
  old-path references (50+52 files, incl. backslash variants and the `docs/CAMERA_*`
  glob); generated area `README.md` indexes from each doc's H1 (camera 18/18,
  movement 7/7, engine_host 3/3, ui 2/2, audio 1/1; netcode 21/21, controls 10/10,
  pvp 2/2); added `docs/README.md` master index; updated `AGENTS.md` §3/§10 paths.
- Evidence: stale-path sweep → 0; registration audit output; this commit.
- Outcome: solved. `docs/` root is exactly `README.md`,
  `GAME_SYSTEMS_RESEARCH_MAP.md`, `EXPERIENCES.md`.

### 2026-09-29 — repo — Finalize: merge the cleanup branch into main
- Did: merged `cleanup/repo-tidy` into `main` (`085daa7`, 21 commits) and pushed.
  The branch carried: repo consolidation (web/legacy removal, union anim-picker
  merge), client naming (`reborn_client.exe`), launcher repurpose, Desktop
  consolidation, agent-rules alignment, note inventory, and the docs area
  reorganization.
- Evidence: merge commit `085daa7`; `origin/main` updated in the same session.
- Outcome: solved.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — penetration research inventory + main-tip drift audit
- Did: read the camera docs set (`PENETRATION_PLAN`, `WALL_OBSTRUCTION`,
  `HANDOFF`, `HOST_DEVIATIONS`, `COMPLETION_PLAN`, `CLOSE_RANGE_RESEARCH`,
  `FIX_SUGGESTIONS`, `CONFORMANCE_CHECKS`), the camera git history
  (`bdfb586`..`3fd31b4`), and the live code camera block (`RebornClient.cs`,
  `CameraSystem.CameraObstruction`, `FoliageCollision.Raycast`). Confirmed main
  carries the engine look-at/absolute-Y path (D3/B6 closed), 5/9 probes with
  the per-mesh `.cflags` gate, NoCross/scene-min/degenerate-hit guards and the
  `RC_CAM_PENDBG` recorder. Drifts found: (1) the live default
  `RC_CAM_HITWIN`/`RC_CAM_HITWINDOW` is `0`, so B11 hit stabilization is OFF on
  main although `PENETRATION_PLAN` C1d and `HOST_DEVIATIONS` B11 say 0.25 s
  default-on (all added in the `3fd31b4` WIP checkpoint); (2) `docs/controls/
  CONTROLS_GAP_REGISTER.md` S9 and `docs/camera/CONFORMANCE_CHECKS.md` still
  describe the pre-obstruction state; (3) generated foliage bins + `.cflags`
  remain tracked under `engine_host_spike/collision_data`.
- Side-job queue (from `PENETRATION_PLAN`): P0 recorder audit on T1-T4 with the
  current build; P4 missing drawn classes (landscape/bd/subscene -> camera-only
  FCOL); P2 probe footprint (blocked, live host recon); P5 band-aid removal
  after the audit.
- Evidence: `git merge-base --is-ancestor 3fd31b4 main` -> true;
  `client/RebornClient.cs:429,1854,1941`; `client/FoliageCollision.cs:452`.
- Outcome: partial (research done, fix queue defined, drifts not yet fixed).

### 2026-09-29 — camera — T1 penetration root cause: front-only probes; double-sided fix landed
**Problem:** after the engine look-at/guard work the user still reported wall
penetration. The Step-1 recorder had never been run over the T1 sweep, and the
T1 cavity (`18985,682,24515`) is the original user spot.
**Tried:** built the workstream client `reborn_client_camclip.exe` (and first
fixed `client/build_client.cmd` to honor the AGENTS §2 `RC_CLIENT_EXE`
contract it claimed to implement), re-ran the T1 demo sweep with
`RC_CAM_PENDBG=1`, then A/B'd the front-only probe filter and the hit window.
**Outcome:** solved (fix landed, default on).
**Why:** main-tip defaults produced 18 event lines / 192 event-frames at T1:
the resolved camera sat on the far side of rock shell inst 897 (reverse bake
hit 1-2 u from the camera) and of scene-only geometry (reverse scene hit 6-11 u,
bake clear) while the forward front-face-only probes were blind - once the
camera slips past a surface whose front faces it, the forward query can never
see it again and the spring returns through the geometry. A/B: front-only
192 frames; front-only + hit-window(0.25 s) 118; **double-sided 0**.
`RC_CAM_BACKFACE` now defaults on (`=0` restores front-only), registered as
B14 with the real `FilterCamera` (D1) winding rule as the exit. Exact
regressions: T2 `hit=206 len=188`, T4 `hit=186 len=168`, T1 `hit=11 len=0`,
userspot idle pull 155 (`hit=173`) 0 jumps, 45 s route 0 events/jumps,
camera_smoke ALL PASS, exit 0/DONE.
Also corrected a doc/code drift: B11 hit stabilization is opt-in on main
(`RC_CAM_HITWIN` default 0), not the C1d "shipped 0.25".
**Re-open criteria:** the native `FilterCamera` winding rule is recovered, or
double-sided probes cause over-pulling somewhere (kill switch `RC_CAM_BACKFACE=0`).
**Links:** `docs/camera/PENETRATION_PLAN.md` progress log 2026-09-29 (camclip);
`docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` B11/B14; logs `reborn_20260929_122635`
(before) and `_123534`/`_123619`/`_123704`/`_123851`/`_123947` (after) in
`bin64\reborn_out`.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — client-truth max defaults (follow distance 2000 u, 广角 60°)
- Did: user decision "default both to true max = client truth": the character
  follow distance default moved from the invented 6 m placeholder to **2000 u
  (20 m)** - the client's own maximum (`VideoSettingPanel.fMaxCameraDistance`
  default 2000, engine cap 2000, `JX3RepresentX64` const blob `0x180d2af90`);
  广角 default stays the client's panel maximum **60°** (log source renamed
  `client-max-default`; the engine `fMaxCameraAngle` cap is not recoverable in
  this install). Also carried the session build tag (`Camera Pen v3`) and the
  `obstdbg` instance/flag logging.
- Evidence: `client/camera.json` character row, `CameraSystem.cs:101/129/142`,
  `RebornClient.cs:488/889`, `VideoSettings.cs`,
  `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` C6/C10;
  `camera_smoke_wallclip.exe` **ALL PASS (26 checks**, incl. the new
  "distance default = client max 2000 u"); live log
  `reborn_20260929_162023.log`: `CameraSystem ready: ... dist=2000u`,
  `fov source=... angle=60.00`.
- Outcome: solved. Committed on `agent/camera-wall-clip`; **not pushed** (new
  main rule `ff67fff`: never push unless explicitly asked). The per-slug test
  client picks the config from `bin64\reborn_campen_v3\camera.json`.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — "zooms in while turning, returns when I stop" (B15)
**Problem:** user report: pressing W (running a slope/turning) the camera
continuously zoomed in "for no reason", then sprang back to the 2000 u default
after stopping.
**Tried:** reproduced with `RC_CAM_DEBUG/SHAKEDBG/OBSTDBG/PENDBG` (log
`reborn_20260929_163131`): the penetration recorder showed **0 events** and
`betweendbg` clear, `hit=-1` on every frame of the burst - so the pull was not
geometry. `jumpdbg` showed `offLen` collapsing 2050 -> 1520 u in ~60 ms at a
fast camera flick, then recovering over ~3 s.
**Outcome:** solved (fix landed in code; live feel check pending).
**Why:** the per-axis SmoothTime smoothing of the *rotating* orbit offset
shortens the vector through its chord; the obstruction state machine received
that shortened `offLen` as its desired length and, since `target < Distance`
applies immediately (the engine's no-threshold shortening rule), snapped the
camera in - then the 1.5/2.828 flex eased it back over seconds. Fix: probes +
`CameraObstruction` now use the **raw desired offset** (the candidate line the
engine queries); the per-axis smoothing stays once, on the resolved offset
(`rSm`). The double `camOffSmooth` stage was removed.
**Re-open criteria:** a fast flick still produces a resolved-length jump in
`jumpdbg` (`smstep` > 2 u), or the T2/T4 obstruction invariants drift.
**Links:** `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` B15; logs `_163131` (before),
`_165430` (after); `client/RebornClient.cs`.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — "still happens": sprint row still targeted 6 m
- Did: user retest still showed "press W (Shift) -> camera zooms in, stop ->
  back". Log `reborn_20260929_165430` camdbg: `mode=sprint dist=1334 -> 905 ->
  660`, then `mode=character dist=1995` - the **sprint row** still carried the
  old 6 m placeholder, so Shift+W ramped the distance target 2000 -> 660 and
  back. (The B15 fix is visible in the same log: during a ~7 rad/s flick the
  raw `offLen` moves but the smoothed camera `sm` stays ~2018, no collapse.)
- Fix: sprint row `TargetDistance`/`InitCameraDistance` = 20 m in
  `camera.json` + `CameraSystem.DefaultRow`, same client-truth max as the
  character row. The sprint pull-back (+60 u) clamps at the 2000 u max.
- Evidence: `reborn_20260929_171501` (`CameraSystem ready: ... dist=2000u`),
  `camera_smoke_wallclip` ALL PASS. Outcome: solved pending user feel check.

### 2026-09-29 — controls — operation-modes implementation plan (CLASSICAL/JOYSTICK)
- Did: wrote `docs/controls/OPERATION_MODES_PLAN.md` (registered in the
  controls index): game truth per mode, input routing matrix, switch key
  (`F7` host + `RC_MODE` env; the real client switches via the
  `UISetting_Operation_Switch` panel and has no default hotkey), per-mode
  settings (`nCameraModeInClassicMode/JoystickMode`), phases P0-P4 and tests.
  Found that the client already has a partial joystick branch keyed off the
  **wrong** setting (`tCameraStatic.nCameraMode == 1`, the follow mode, at
  `RebornClient.cs:806-823`) - P1 moves it onto an explicit `OperationMode`.
- Evidence: `docs/controls/JX3_CAMERA_CONTROLS.md` §3,
  `controls/RESEARCH_RESOLVED_GAPS.md` §4-5,
  `proof/controls/ui_lua/OperationSwitch.joystick.txt`,
  `hotkeys_script.dump.txt`.
- Outcome: plan committed; implementation starts at P0 on request.
- Re-open: implement P0 when the user picks it up (no code changes yet).

### 2026-09-29 — controls — operation modes P0-P2 landed (F7 switch)
- Did: implemented the plan: `CameraOperationMode` pure gating model +
  `CameraSettings.OperationMode` with `RC_MODE`, `F7` toggle (host key; real
  client switches via the UI panel), `op=` in `camdbg`, `OPMODE=` fingerprint;
  moved the always-rotate/cursor-lock branch off `tCameraStatic.nCameraMode`
  onto the operation mode; joystick disables the RMB body-turn (body follows
  the movement heading). Per-mode follow values (`nCameraModeIn*Mode`) are
  parsed + logged; applying them and the turn-rate model stay open (P2/P3
  partial). Controls register C12 -> PARTIAL.
- Evidence: `client/CameraSystem.cs` (`CameraOperationMode`),
  `client/CameraSettings.cs`, `client/RebornClient.cs`;
  `camera_smoke_wallclip` ALL PASS (29 checks: mode gating + parse);
  `RC_MODE=joystick` run `reborn_20260929_175413.log` (`op=joystick`, DONE,
  exit 0); test client rebuilt (`reborn_client_campen_v3.exe`, merged tree +
  ported edits, log `reborn_20260929_175819.log`, `OPMODE=classical`).
- Outcome: P0-P2 solved (P2 partial), P3 partial, P4 open.
- Re-open: turn-rate model + follow-mode semantics + reset-speed application.

### 2026-09-29 — camera — default follow distance corrected to 1245 u (cap vs initial)
**Problem:** after the "max default" change the camera terrain-pulled constantly
("zooms in for no reason"): `jumpdbg src=[probe4 ... terr=1934->1365]`,
`obstdbg probe0 ... terr=671` at rest, `clamp=1` - the native 5-probe query
pulling because a 2000 u camera sits at ground level behind the player.
**Tried:** traced the original game's distance sources in the disassembly and
shipped data instead of guessing again.
**Outcome:** solved (default changed to 1245 u; exact initial value still not
provable from local data).
**Why:** `fMaxCameraDistance` (default 2000, custom.dat) is only the zoom-out
cap - `SetCameraMaxDistance` `0x180ace520` clamps and writes the camera node's
cap field `+0x74`/`+0x8C`, never the current distance. The character camera
reads **no** `InitCameraDistance` (string xrefs only in the air-combat
`0x180ac9db5` and carrier `0x180b1c876` loaders). The distance is not persisted
either (`g_Scene_tCameraRuntime` = yaw/pitch/eyeScale only). The only shipped
camera-distance number is `number.krl CameraMaxDistance = 1245 u`, loaded into
`CommonNumber+0x98`; no reader of that field was located in this build (same
as the documented legacy `NearByWallDistance`), so 1245 is the best
client-authored value but the exact initial distance remains unproven until
the CDN `camera_common.krl.txt` row is obtained.
**Re-open criteria:** a `CommonNumber+0x98` reader is found (proves/refutes
1245), or the CDN per-mode row arrives.
**Links:** `docs/camera/HOST_DEVIATIONS.md` C10; `proof/netcode/disasm/
camera_maxdistance_xrefs.txt` (loader store at `+0x98`),
`camera_sLoad_calls.txt`, `camera_wall_obstruction.txt` §11;
`proof/gravity/number.krl.txt`. Code: `camera.json` (character + sprint rows),
`CameraSystem.cs`, `CameraSmoke.cs` (`distance default = client number 1245 u`),
live log `reborn_20260929_181215.log` (before), `camera_smoke_wallclip` ALL
PASS after.
